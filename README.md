# text-analysis-using-R
This is the final project of machine learning course in UPITTS
What I did:
  Built linear, SVM, Random Forest, Neural Network, and other models to predict customers’ behavior in Regression and Classification
  Explored and visualized the distributions and relationships of derived text features
  Fit, trained, tuned, and assessed the performance of different models with resampling
  Compared and identified the best Regression model(Random Forest Model) based on the metric of RMSE, and the best Classification model(Neural Network Model) based on the metric of ROC
  Used PCA as the pre-processing method to increase the best models(RF and NN)’s performances (the R-Squared of RF from 0.63 to 0.66 and the ROC of NN from 0.78 to 0.84)
